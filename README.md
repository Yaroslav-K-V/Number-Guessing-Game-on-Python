User-friendly interface: The game provides clear instructions and feedback to guide the user.

Random number generation: The game generates a random number within the specified range for each round.

Number guessing timer: Using the Python library, the time taken by the user to guess a number is calculated.

Saving records: Using the OS and JSON libraries, the saving of player records is implemented. The text file is created at the first game. As a result of a successful number guess, the user's name, the number of used attempts, and the game time are stored in the file.
The display of these statistics is also implemented.
